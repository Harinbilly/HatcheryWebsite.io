   <h1>Types of Sea Turtles spotted across the hatcheries in Sri Lanka</h1> <br>     
   <h2>Green Sea Turtle</h2>
  <center><img src="Images/greensea turtle.jpg" alt="" width="25%"></center> 
   <p>This is one of the most commonly found turtle species in Sri Lanka. They are so named because of the presence of
     the green fat tissues beneath their upper shell. While the younger ones are mostly carnivorous, the adult ones
      are herbivorous. Green turtles can grow up to a length of 1 meter and can weigh around 250 kilograms. Adult female 
      green turtles are known to lay off around 120 to 140 eggs at a time. The best time to locate them is night as they 
      usually wander around the shore in the darkness.</p>

<h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>

<center><img src="Images/hawksbill.jpeg" alt="" width="25%"></center> 
<p>This species of the Turtle of Sri Lanka is accounted to be rarest amongst the others and is often observed to reach the heigh
    t of 90 cm. Their weights vary significantly between 50 to 70 kg and are identified by their bird-like-beak protruding from their
     narrow head. They make the best use of their beak for catching the animals hiding deep under the small crevices. These turtles are
      tagged as regular Sri Lanka visitors. Also, their shells are beautiful, with around 13 symmetrical vibrant pieces. </p>

<h2>Leatherback Turtles</h2>
<center><img src="Images/leatherback.jpg" alt="" width="25%"></center>
<p>The Leatherback Turtles are the largest of all the critically endangered turtle species across the globe. They are accounted as one of the rarest finds in and around the soils of Sri Lanka. The identification of these leatherback turtles is made from their front flippers and its intricately carved shell reflecting black and white stripes.  <br><br>

It has got a thin, rubbery and tough carapace which imparts its characteristic leathery touch to these turtles. Besides, these turtles are known to possess a blood circulatory system, which reflects that of a cold-blooded reptile. This helps the marine animal to keep their body warm with the aid of the metabolic heat of their muscle activity. These animals can reach up to 3 meters in length and weigh around 750 k

<h1>Hello and Welcome</h1>
<p>Here you will find lots of information about Sri Lanka's pioneering sea turtle conservation project - why Sri Lanka
     (and the village of Kosgoda in particular) is a prime turtle nesting site, why the conservation project is needed and how 
     the project is operated by local people with the help of international volunteers</p>

<h1>Hatchery works in the following steps</h1>

<ul>
    <li>Staff patrols beach at nights looking for mother sea turtles that come out of the sea to lay eggs.</li>
    <li>They protect the mother from afar during the nesting process, until she finishes laying the eggs and returns to the ocean.</li>
    <li>The eggs are relocated from beach to hatchery to protect them from predators and irresponsible human action.</li>
    <li>In addition fishermen are also paid to bring any turtle eggs they find to the hatchery.</li>
    <li>The eggs develop and hatch in a protected area. This may take between 45-60 days.</li>
    <li>The hatched turtles are released into the ocean on the same day if no complications arise. This is to avoid human interference in their lifestyles as much as possible.</li>

    </ul>

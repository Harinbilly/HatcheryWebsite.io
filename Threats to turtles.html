                    It’s estimated that the fishing industry contributes to the death of thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles
                     each year. Turtles that become trapped in longlines, gill nets and trawls are thrown away as bycatch. And those 
                     that manage to avoid fishing nets are impacted by the disruption to their food supply and habitat.

                    Every year, sea turtle habitats are destroyed because of shrinking coastlines. Wherever there is boat vessel

                     and beach erosion sea turtle food supplies and nesting areas take a major hit.

                    Marine pollution can harm sea turtles in many ways. Plastic pollution, discarded fishing gear, petroleum 
                    by-products, and other debris injure sea turtles through ingestion and entanglement. Ocean pollution can also
                     weaken the turtles’ immune systems, and disrupt nesting behavior and hatchling orientation.

                    of their shells. And even though today the global trade of luxury and craft items has reduced thanks to
                     conservation efforts, it still remains an ongoing threat to turtles in parts of Africa, Asia and the Americas.

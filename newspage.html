   <center> <img src="Images/ghost-net-victim-azura-orp-turtle-rescue-centre-maldives.jpg" alt=""></center> <br>
   <p style="font-size: 20pt;">A green sea turtle who was caught in a fishing net was found in the southern coast of Sri Lanka.
    One of our interns named the turtle Cersei inspired by a character in the famous tv show "The Game of Thrones". Cersei was brought
    to our rescue center where our doctors did a clinical check up on the poor creature. Cersei sustained minor injuries to its 
    flippers. Cersei was treated and was kept at the hatchery for 2 more weeks to monitor her condition. Once the vets 
    decided it was safe to release Cersei back to the ocean, the UDU'S Turtles release Team released Cersei back to the ocean.</p>


<h1>News about Sheldon</h1>
<center><img src="Images/Turtle01.jpg" alt=""></center>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 20pt;">An injured leatherback sea turtle was found in Mount Lavinia by a group of school students in the month of February.
    These quick thinking boys contacted our Turtle rescue team at once. The name "Sheldon" was given to the turtle by one of the students themselves.
    Our rescue team had to perform a delicate operation on the creature to remove plastic straws which the turtle had swallowed. The turtle's 
    condition is now stable, but for the time being the vets and our rescue team decided it is best not to release the animal
    back to the ocean any time soon.   </p>

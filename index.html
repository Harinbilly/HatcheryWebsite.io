            <p>Sri Lanka is home to many globally endangered species, including sea turtles. Sea turtle hatcheries are commonly seen on 
                Sri Lanka's western and southers coasts. The best time to visit a Sea Turtle  Hatchery  is when the female 
                sea turtles return to their nestling grounds to lay their eggs. During this time, these sea turtles will be in a trance-like state
                and will not be alarmed by the presence of bystanders. </p>

                <tr><td><p> Presently, there are five species of turtles that are taken care of in the hatchery and rescue centre. Such species are 
                    the Olive Ridley Turtle, Leatherback Turtle, Loggerhead Turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, and Green Turtle. The facilities of the sea 
                    turtle hatchery and rescue centre are all state-of-the-art, complete with water tanks to care for newborn turtles, along with 
                    adult turtle species that have been rescued from the sea due to injuries. One of the more peculiar sights in the centre is the 
                    area in which the turtles lay their eggs, as they have distinct little mounds of sand piled neatly between one another.
                     Each of these mounds is monitored closely to calculate the hatching process of the turtle eggs.

            <h1> Reasons for the demise of Sea Turtles</h1><p class="reference">
(The beauty of Conversion, retrieved from <a href="https://ahangama.w15.lk/experiences/sea-turtle-hatchery">https://ahangama.w15.lk/experiences/sea-turtle-hatchery</a>)</p> 
          <center><img src="Images/inhured.jpg" alt="" width="40%" class="main"></center>
          <p>According to the World Conservation Union, there are five main underlying reasons for the unexpected demise of the sea turtles â€“ <br><br>
            <ol>

                <li> The fisheries present across the globe are the reasons why the sea turtle hatcheries are being adversely affected. The consequence of the presence of such fisheries 
at the hatching sites of these sea turtles has to lead to their death due to entanglement, 
destruction of their habitat, and sudden changes in their food web. <br><br></li>

<li> It is a common scenario where the sea turtles and their eggs are often killed by people.
 This is usually done in the benefit of mankind for oil, shells, and leather production. <br><br></li>

<li> The coastal development process often results in the destruction of all the habitats of these sea turtles.
 These may include the alterations introduced both at the shoreline and at the sea-shore. <br><br></li>

<li> The presence of plastics, petroleum by-products, debris, and discarded fishing gears often results in their
 bioaccumulation within the sea turtle species. <br><br></li>

<li> The several different climatic changes result in alteration of the nesting processes at the nesting sites.
 This may be related to the modifications introduced in the habitats of the sea turtle or due to the transformations
  of the basic oceanographic processes. <br><br></li></p>
